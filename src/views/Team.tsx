                                People are pretty smart. And when it really matters, they can understand the things that influence their lives. The problem is that the important things don't tend to come with a handbook. That's where we fit.

                                Ross may be the science guy, but I've always been more of a history buff.

We want to be those storytellers â€“ explaining the things you see, do, and hear about every day.
